#### Domain Model Update

During the creation of the operation contract for the scanItem operation, we as a group re-evaluated the TransportVehicle entity. Due to the association formed between the Item and Transport Vehicle, we contemplated adding an attribute to account for the Items loaded in the Transport Vehicle. However, with the relational simplicity of the Domain Model being a priority, we realized that this relation is better represented as a association. Additionally, an itemID attribute was added to the ItemDescription entity to improve its descriptiveness.

#### Group work distribution

- We split up the work as evenly as we could.
- Jose and Jitesh worked on updated the domain model and creating the SSD.
- Patrick and Joel revised the domain model as well and created the operational contract.

#### Percents 

- domain model update (25% each)
- SSD (70% Jitesh & Jose for work, edits by Patrick & Joel 30%)
- Operational Contract (50% Joel, 50% Patrick)
