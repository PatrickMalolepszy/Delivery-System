#Domain Model

####Avoid a waterfall-mindset big-modeling effort to make a thorough or "correct" domain model - it won't ever be either, and such over-modeling efforts lead to analysis paralysis, with little or no return on the investment.

####A domain model is a visual representation of conceptual classes or real-situation objects in a domain.
