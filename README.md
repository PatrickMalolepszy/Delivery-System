Fictional Store delivery system created for 60-322 project at the University of Windsor.

The store or warehouse has to request an item which will be processed by a POS system which will create the outline of how the item will be sent to the requested location. This item can be delivered by our 'driver' in either boat, plane, or truck. Once delivered to a warehouse or store it will be approved by the end-user.

Transport vehicle from a supplier arrives at the company's location. A warehouse manager/receiver verifies the number of items expected to be received, and the cargo is unloaded. Inventory counts are updated for received items, and confirmation of successful delivery is recorded. Deliveries expecting cargo from this shipment are made aware of new stock totals.
